# Clustering-Algorithm-

The assessment  demonstrates the application of clustering techniques using the Iris dataset from the sklearn library. Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning method, is employed to group data points based on their features without using predefined labels. The project focuses on two popular clustering algorithms: KMeans Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering. These techniques are implemented step-by-step, beginning with preprocessing the Iris dataset, which includes standardization and removing the species column, to ensure that clustering is performed purely on feature data. Visualizations are provided to interpret and validate the clustering results effectively.

KMeans clustering divides the dataset into a specified number of clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster, making it suitable for numerical data like the Iris dataset. Hierarchical clustering, on the other hand, organizes data into a tree-like structure (dendrogram), allowing insights into the hierarchical relationships between data points. The results are visualized using scatter plots and dendrograms to provide a clear representation of the clusters formed. This project not only serves as an educational exercise but also demonstrates the practical applicability of clustering techniques to real-world datasets.
